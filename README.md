# ARImageTargetExample

I have created a Image Target Example of Vuforia using Unity.
Unity version is Unity 2018.4.12f1 (64-bit).

Adding a Vuforia AR Camera and other GameObjects
To add an AR Camera to your scene, go to GameObject > Vuforia > AR Camera.

If this is the first Vuforia GameObject added to your Scene then Unity also prompts to import your Vuforia Assets. Select Import, and Unity imports all necessary Vuforia files into your project.

Creating a Vuforia license key
The last step in the setup process is to create a license key from the License Manager section of the Vuforia Developer Portal. You need to enter this into Unityâ€™s Vuforia configuration settings in order to build and test your application with Unity.

Visit the Vuforia Developer Portal and log in (or create a new account). Navigate to the License Manager in the Develop section and click the Get Development Key button to open the Add License Key page.
